## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Observations

- Some social medias links arent supposed to go to my profile (Frontend Mentor, Twitter and Instagram), because my profile on those social medias are personal. So, in these cases, the links send the user to the social media home page. They are there just for show that is possible have these links.
